## How to Run:

[Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaushil268/disease-prediction-using-machine-learning)

Place "Testing.csv" & "Training.csv" inside of the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook file.


To run, open the Jupyter Notebook file, Health_and_Medicine_Final_Project.ipynb in Jupyter. From there, select "Run All Cells" with a kernel running Python 3.9.7. If the first cell fails to run, use pip install to install the required library on your computer before continuing. Do not proceed until this block has no errors. 


## Note:
With permission of the instructor, all code was written in one group session with one PC, hence the lack of individual commits in this GitHub repository. The full breakdown of division of labor can be found in the attached "Division of Labor: Final Project Pt 3" PDF.
